# TCP to HTTP Course Project

## This repository contains my personal course project from boot.dev


## Note: This is not an original project.

### I am learning everything step by step and keeping detailed notes in LEARNING.md.

### This is not a simple copy-paste; all implementations reflect my understanding as I progress through the lessons.
